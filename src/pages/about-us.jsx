                    Nishok and Prashanth, the young and visionary minds behind Nipix Technology, launched the company in 2023 with a shared passion for revolutionizing education through practical learning. Despite starting without any prior background in the industry, they have achieved remarkable milestones together. Their journey began with a hands-on robotics workshop at Avadi Government School, where they successfully trained 100 students. This was just the beginning.

                <p className='text-lg font-medium'>    
                    Since then, Nipix Technology has trained over 600 students through more than five workshops across schools and colleges, making a significant impact on young learners. They are now gearing up for a grand Project Expo in Thanjavur on August 1, 2024, where government officials will witness the results of their dedication. The Nipix team is committed to providing a 5-day intensive training session before the expo, transforming students from beginners to proficient in Arduino, sensors, actuators, and Python programming. This level of effort and dedication is what drives Nipix Technology to deliver exceptional learning experiences in every workshop.
